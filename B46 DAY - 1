Write a  blog on difference between HTTP1 VS HTTP2.
Ans: HTTP1 
      It loads resources one after the another, so if one resource cannot be loaded , it blocks all the other resources behind it.
      It loads a single request for every TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) connection.
     HTTP2
         It is able to use a single TCP(Transmission control protocol) connection to send multiple streams of data at once ,
         so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
         In HTTP2 ,developers have hands on detailed control over prioritization.
         This allows them to maximize perceived and actual page load speed to a degree that was not possible in HTTP1.
         
         2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript.
         Ans:   object
                     An object is a reference data type, and it forms the building blocks of modern javascript.
                     Objects in javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data,of primitive or reference data types.
                     A property of an onject can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.
                     Properties of an javascript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation().
                     Objects are sometimes called as assosiative arrays, since each property is associated with a string value.
